\section{Introduction}

Habeas is to be a language based directly on linear logic.
The language will have a construct for each of the derivation rules of LL.
The rules are treated below.

\section{General notes about the rules}

Because of the difference in semantics between commas occurring on the
left and on the right side of the turnstiles, we will here write the
right-hand ones as semicolons instead, in an attempt to reduce risk of
confusing ourselves.

\paragraph{Concepts.} Central concepts regarding how the rules of
linear logic are to be translated into programming language constructs
are: types, variables, and values. These are as known from other
programming languages.

As it turns out, in linear logic there is an additional useful concept
which we will call \emph{activation records}.  This term, too, is
known from other programming languages, but activation records are
perhaps more visible at the low level in linear logic.

\paragraph{How to read the rules.} A raw type rule typically looks like this:
$$
{\Gamma,A \vdash B;\Delta}\over{\Gamma,A' \vdash B';\Delta}
$$

The mathematical reading of this is, ``if we can prove ${\Gamma,A
  \vdash B;\Delta}$, then we can prove ${\Gamma,A' \vdash B';\Delta}$''.


The interpretation of this rule as a programming language construct is
somewhat different:
\begin{quote}
  ''Starting with a value of type $A'$ (and possibly some other values
  $\Gamma$), we get to a state where we have a value of type $A$ (and
  still $\Gamma$, unchanged). Then control passes to some sub-part of
  the construct; when this part is done, it has left an activation
  record of type $B$ as well as some other activation records
  $\Delta$. The construct then transforms this into an activation
  record of type $B'$ (and still $\Delta$, unchanged).''
\end{quote}

Thus, the control flow is from the left-hand side of the lower rule to
the left-hand side of the upper rule (or rules -- there may be more
than one; there may even be zero); then through the steps prescribed
by whatever proof tree(s) are there to prove the upper rule(s); then
from the right-hand side of the upper rule(s) down to the right-hand
side of the lower rule.

In general, there are a number of values available, and a number of
activation records are produced.

\paragraph{The cast.} Linear logic contains four binary connectives (type operators) and
one unary operator:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{c|l|l}
    \hline
    \hline
    Operator & Name & Approximate meaning\\
    \hline
    $\otimes$ & Times & Product type\\
    $\oplus$  & Plus  & Sum type\\
    $\&$      & With  & Choice type\\
    $|$       & Par   & Independent evaluation\\
    \hline
    $\lnot$   & Not   & Resource sink\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Each of the four binary operators have a neutral element:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|l|l}
    \hline
    \hline
    Operator & Neutral & Name & Approximate meaning\\
             & element &&\\
    \hline
    $\otimes$ & $1$    & One    & Void/unit\\
    $\oplus$  & $0$    & Zero   & Impossible to create\\
    $\&$      & $\top$ & Top    & Impossible to destroy\\
    $|$       & $\bot$ & Bottom & The terminated activation record\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


\section{Linear Logic Rules and Habeas Language Constructs}

In the following we go through each of the derivation rules of linear
logic and see, what language construct each gives rise to.


\subsection{Rules for $\otimes$, the Product Type}
% If Γ,A,B,Δ⊢Θ, then Γ,A⊗B,Δ⊢Θ; conversely, if Γ⊢Δ,A and Λ⊢B,Θ, then Γ,Λ⊢Δ,A⊗B,Θ.

\subsubsection{Product introduction}
\paragraph{Rule:}
$$
{
 {\Gamma_1 \vdash A;\Delta_1}
 \qquad
 {\Gamma_2 \vdash B;\Delta_2}
}\over{
 \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash A \otimes B ; \Delta_1 ; \Delta_2
}
$$

\paragraph{What goes on:} Two subexpressions create values of type $A$
and $B$, respectively. These two values are then combined into a value
of product type $A \otimes B$.

% Of the available values, some go to creating a value of type $A$ (and a set of activation records), while the rest go to creating a value of type $B$ (and another set of activation records). The two values are then combined into a value of product type $A \otimes B$ (and the union of the activation records).

\paragraph{Constraints and impact:} The available values are divided
between the two subexpressions.  Any extra activation records created
by the two subexpressions continue to exist.
The three values involved in the transformation must each be alone in
their activation record.

\paragraph{Language construct:} Tuple creation, denoted by
\begin{quote}\tt
  (tuple ($e_1$ $e_2$ $\ldots$ $e_n$))
\end{quote}
(Note that the language construct is $n$-ary rather than binary.)

\subsubsection{Product elimination}
\paragraph{Rule:}
$$
{
  \Gamma, A, B \vdash \Delta
}\over{
  \Gamma, A\otimes B \vdash \Delta
}
$$

\paragraph{What goes on:} A value of type $A \otimes B$ is split into two values of type $A$ and $B$, respectively.
\paragraph{Constraints and impact:} The value of type $A \otimes B$ is consumed; the two new values become available; all other available values continue to exist.
\paragraph{Language construct:} Tuple deconstruction, denoted by
\begin{quote}\tt
  (untuple ($v_1$ $v_2$ $\ldots$ $v_n$) $e_{tuple}$ $e_{body}$)
\end{quote}
(Note that the language construct is $n$-ary rather than binary.)\\
The variables $v_i$ are bound to the elements of the tuple, and are available in the expression $e_{body}$.



\subsection{Rules for $\oplus$, the Sum Type}
% Dually, if Γ⊢Δ,A,Θ or Γ⊢Δ,B,Θ, then Γ⊢Δ,A⊕B,Θ; conversely, if Γ,A,Δ⊢Θ and Γ,B,Δ⊢Θ, then Γ,A⊕B,Δ⊢Θ.


\subsubsection{Sum introduction}
\paragraph{Rule:}
$$
{{
  \Gamma \vdash A;\Delta
}\over{
  \Gamma \vdash A \oplus B;\Delta
}}
\qquad \textrm{and} \qquad
{{
  \Gamma \vdash B;\Delta
}\over{
  \Gamma \vdash A \oplus B;\Delta
}}
$$

\paragraph{What goes on:} A value of type $A$ or of type $B$ is
converted into a value of type $A \oplus B$.

\paragraph{Constraints and impact:} The value of type $A$ or $B$ is
consumed; the new value becomes available; all other available values
continue to exist.
The two values involved in the transformation must each be alone in
their activation record.

\paragraph{Language construct:} Sumtype injection, denoted by
\begin{quote}\tt
  (inject $\mathit{tag}$ $e$)
\end{quote}
(Note that the language construct is $n$-ary rather than binary, and
uses symbolic choice tags.)


\subsubsection{Sum elimination}
\paragraph{Rule:}
$$
{
% if Γ,A,Δ⊢Θ and Γ,B,Δ⊢Θ, then Γ,A⊕B,Δ⊢Θ.
  \Gamma,A \vdash \Delta \qquad \Gamma,B \vdash \Delta
}\over{
  \Gamma, A\oplus B \vdash \Delta
}
$$

\paragraph{What goes on:} A value of type $A \oplus B$ is converted to
a value of type either $A$ or $B$. That value is then handled of one
of two subexpressions -- one for $A$ and one for $B$.

\paragraph{Constraints and impact:} The value of type $A \oplus B$ is
consumed; the value of type $A$ or type $B$ becomes available.
All other values remain available regardless of which subexpression is chosen.

Furthermore, the same set of other activation records (with the same
types) must be produced by the two subexpressions. This is also the
set of activation records produced by the entire expression.

\paragraph{Language construct:}
\begin{quote}\tt
  (case $e$\\
  \phantom{ }\quad ($\mathit{tag_1}$ $\mathit{e_1}$)\\
  \phantom{ }\quad \ldots\\
  \phantom{ }\quad ($\mathit{tag_n}$ $\mathit{e_n}$))
\end{quote}
(Note that the language construct is $n$-ary rather than binary, and
uses symbolic injection tags.)



\subsection{Rules for $\&$, the Choice Type}
% If Γ⊢Δ,A,Θ and Γ⊢Δ,B,Θ, then Γ⊢Δ,A&B,Θ.

\subsubsection{Choice introduction}

\paragraph{Rule:}
$$
{
  \Gamma \vdash A; \Delta
  \qquad
  \Gamma \vdash B; \Delta
}\over{
  \Gamma \vdash A\&B; \Delta
}
$$
\paragraph{What goes on:} Two subexpressions which differ in that one
produces a value of type $A$ and the other produces a value of type
$B$ are combined into a value of type $A\&B$.

\paragraph{Constraints and impact:} The two subexpressions must not
otherwise differ in which values they consume and which types of activation
records they produce.

\paragraph{Language construct:}
\begin{quote}\tt
  (choice\\
  \phantom{ }\quad ($\mathit{tag}_1$ $e_1$)\\
  \phantom{ }\quad \ldots\\
  \phantom{ }\quad ($\mathit{tag}_n$ $e_n$))
\end{quote}
(Note that the language construct is $n$-ary rather than binary, and
uses symbolic injection tags.)
The evaluation of the subexpressions themselves is postponed until the
choice is made.
\\(TODO: What about the extra activation records produced?)

\subsubsection{Choice elimination}

% If Γ,A,Δ⊢Θ or Γ,B,Δ⊢Θ, then Γ,A&B,Δ⊢Θ

\paragraph{Rule:}
$$
{{
  \Gamma, A \vdash \Delta
}\over{
  \Gamma, A \& B \vdash \Delta
}}
\qquad \textrm{and} \qquad
{{
  \Gamma, B \vdash \Delta
}\over{
  \Gamma, A \& B \vdash \Delta
}}
$$

\paragraph{What goes on:} A value of a choice type is transformed into
a value of one of the types it contains.

\paragraph{Constraints and impact:} Nothing else happens.
\paragraph{Language construct:}
\begin{quote}\tt
(select $\mathit{tag}$ $e$)
\end{quote}
(Note that the language construct is $n$-ary rather than binary, and
uses symbolic choice tags.)


\subsection{Rules for $|$, the Par Type}

\paragraph{Rule:}
$$
{
}\over{
}
$$
\paragraph{What goes on:}
\paragraph{Constraints and impact:}
\paragraph{Language construct:}
\begin{quote}\tt
\end{quote}



% 'par' + negation provides a function/call mechanism.
% 'with' + negation provides a multi-return-path mechanism.
